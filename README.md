# AIT Datapack Desktop Generator

### *by duzo*


## Usage
This script automatically generates all the files and structures necessary for a custom desktop in [AIT](https://github.com/loqor/ait)

Run the script using [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

aka open command prompt where you saved the file and type this

`python main.py`

Select all the things required in the popups



Only the `main.py` is needed for this script to run, so just download that file
